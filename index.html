                    <p>According to the McCormick Science Institute, indigenous Indian spices were cultivated as early as the 8th century BC in the gardens of Babylon.
                        These native spices are what is known as the <b>7 spices of India:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>coriander</li>
                            <li>clove</li>
                            <li>cinnamon</li>
                            <li>turmeric</li>
                            <li>fenugreek</li>
                            <li>cardamom</li>
                        </ul>
                        They were used for both culinary and health purposes, many of which were included in ancient herbal medicines.
                        In Ayurvedic medicine specifically, spices such as cloves and cardamom were chewed after meals to promote saliva and aid digestion.
