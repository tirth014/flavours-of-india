                        <p><b>Indian cuisine can be broadly divided into four regions: North, South, East, and West. Each
                            region has its unique style of cooking, ingredients, and flavors.</b> <br>
                            In the North, the cuisine is characterized by the use of dairy products like ghee, paneer,
                            and yogurt, as well as wheat-based bread like chapatis and naan. North Indian cuisine is
                            also known for its rich curries, kebabs, and biryanis. <br>
                            In the South, rice is the staple food, and coconut, curry leaves, and tamarind are commonly
                            used ingredients. South Indian cuisine is famous for its dosas, idlis, and vadas, as well as
                            spicy curries and seafood dishes.<br>
                            In the East, the cuisine is influenced by neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and
                            Myanmar. The use of mustard oil and fish is prominent in the cuisine of the Eastern states
                            of India. The famous dishes from this region include rasgulla, sandesh, and luchi.<br>
                            In the West, the cuisine is a blend of sweet and savory flavors, with the use of various
                            spices like cumin, coriander, and turmeric. Gujarati, Rajasthani, and Maharashtrian cuisines
                            are the most popular in this region. Some of the famous dishes include dal baati churma,
                            vada pav, and pav bhaji.
